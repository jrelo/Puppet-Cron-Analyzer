/!\ This is a work in process:

    What works:
        Parsing/storage of puppet catalogs / crons.
        Regex search of all crons.
        Output to ics (iCal).

    TODO:
        Analysis of cron clashes, etc.
        Graphical output per day/week.

Puppet Cron Analyzer

@Author: Charlie Schluting <charlie@schluting.com>

Purpose:
Analyze crons across an infrastructure, and visualize scheduled run times to identify
clashes or hot spots. Also, identifies duplicate crons and allows searching across
all crons in puppet.

Basically, I've found that puppet-managed cron jobs tend to grow and grow...
especially when developers (in addition to ops) are creating them :)

Questions I needed answered:
Are all nightly or hourly map/reduce jobs running at the same time?
Are all backups running at the same time?
Are all multiple jobs that hit mysql or cassandra heavily, running at the same time?
Where can I better schedule some of these clashes?!
Where are we running crons with the string 'foobar'?

Bonus:
This required the implementation of cronlib, which normalizes cron entries into
strictly lists of integers. It can also return a list of all timestamps in the
next year a cron will run.

Requires:
Python 2.7
icalendar module
