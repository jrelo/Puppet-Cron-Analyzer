Puppet Cron Analyzer

@Author: Charlie Schluting <charlie@schluting.com>

Purpose:
Analyze crons across an infrastructure, and visualize scheduled run times to identify
clashes or hot spots. Also, identifies duplicate crons.

Basically, I've found that puppet-managed cron jobs tend to grow and grow... especially
when developers (not ops) are creating them.

Questions I needed answered:
Are all nightly or hourly map/reduce jobs running at the same time?
Are all backups running at the same time?
Are all multiple jobs that hit mysql or cassandra heavily, running at the same time?
Where can I better schedule some of these clashes?!

The first iteration of this script parses out all puppet-managed cron jobs, and
prints an analysis of cron clashes and duplicates. Next, we'll find a way to
visualize crons per-host, per-cluster, and across the infrastructue.
